 * printf, sprintf - formatted output conversion
 *
 * An  implementation  of (s)printf() for LPC, with quite a few extensions

 * @param format the format string
 * @param args the arguments to format
 * @description 
 * This version supports the following as modifiers:
 * 
 * " "     pad positive integers with a space.
 * 
 * "+"     pad positive integers with a plus sign.
 * 
 * "-"     left adjusted within field size.
 * NB: std (s)printf() defaults to right justification,  which  is
 * unnatural  in the context of a mainly string based language but
 * has been retained for "compatability".
 * 
 * "|"     centered within field size.
 * 
 * "="     column mode if strings are greater than  field  size.  This  is
 * only meaningful with strings, all other types ignore this. Col‐
 * umns are auto-magically word wrapped.
 * 
 * "#"     table mode, print a list of '\n' separated 'words' in  a  table
 * within the field size.  only meaningful with strings.
 * 
 * n       specifies  the  field  size,  a '*' specifies to use the corre‐
 * sponding arg as the field size.  If n is prepended with a zero,
 * then  is padded zeros, else it is padded with spaces (or speci‐
 * fied pad string).
 * 
 * "."n    precision of n, simple strings truncate after this  (if  preci‐
 * sion  is greater than field size, then field size = precision),
 * tables use precision to specify the number of columns (if  pre‐
 * cision  not  specified  then  tables calculate a best fit), all
 * other types ignore this.
 * 
 * ":"n    n specifies the fs _and_ the precision, if n is prepended by  a
 * zero then it is padded with zeros instead of spaces.
 * 
 * "@"     the argument is an array.  the corresponding format_info (minus
 * the "@") is applyed to each element of the array.
 * 
 * "'X'"   The char(s) between the single-quotes are used to pad to  field
 * size  (defaults  to  space)  (if both a zero (in front of field
 * size) and a pad string are specified, the one specified  second
 * overrules).   NOTE:  to include "'" in the pad string, you must
 * use "\'" (as the backslash has to be escaped  past  the  inter‐
 * preter), similarly, to include "\" requires "\\".
 * 
 * The following are the possible type specifiers.
 * 
 * %       in  which  case  no  arguments  are  interpreted,  and a "%" is
 * inserted, and all modifiers are ignored.
 * 
 * O       the argument is an LPC datatype.
 * 
 * s       the argument is a string.
 * 
 * d, i    the integer arg is printed in decimal.
 * 
 * c       the integer arg is to be printed as a character.
 * 
 * o       the integer arg is printed in octal.
 * 
 * x       the integer arg is printed in hex.
 * 
 * X       the integer arg is printed in hex (with A-F in capitals).
 * 
 * f       floating point number
 *
 * Basic Usage:
 * ```lpc
 * printf("%s is %i", "X", 1)    =   "X is 1"
 * ```
 * 
 * Alignment:
 * ```lpc
 * printf("%-20s", "left")       =   "left                "
 * printf("%20|s", "center")     =   "       center       "
 * printf("%20s", "right")       =   "               right"
 * printf("%-20'-'s", "left")    =   "left----------------"
 * printf("%20'-'|s", "center")  =   "-------center-------"
 * printf("%20'-'s", "right")    =   "---------------right"
 * ```
 * 
 * Numeric:
 * ```lpc
 * printf("%.2f", 1.2345)        =   "1.23"
 * printf("%10.2f", 1.2345)      =   "      1.23"

 * characters must match, but query_verb() will only return the characters
 * following <cmd>.
