 * exception: if the mapping contains an entry 0:value, it is used
 * for all otherwise unrecognized keys. The value in this case can be
 * a string, or a closure. If it is a closure, it takes the key as
 * argument and has to return the replacement string.
 * 
 * If <map> is given as a closure, it is called with the KEYs to
 * replace, and has to return the replacement string.
 * 
 * The special keys "%^%^" and "%%^^" are always replaced with the
 * literal "%^".
 * 
 * The parameters wrap and indent are both optional, if only wrap is
 * given then the str will be linewrapped at the column given with
 * wrap. If indent is given too, then all wrapped lines will be
 * indented with the number of blanks specified with indent.
 * 
 * The wrapper itself ignores the length of the color macros and that
 * what they contain, it wraps the string based on the length of the
 * other chars inside. Therefore it is color-aware.
 * 
 * If <map> is given as 0, the efun does no colour-define detection
 * and replacement at all, but still does linewrapping and indentation
 * if requested. This way terminal_colour() doubles as a simple
 * line wrapping function, duplicating the functionality also
 * provided by sprintf("%-=s").
 * 
 * 
 * KEY RECOGNITION STRATEGY
 * 
 * As mentioned above, the special keys "%^%^" and "%%^^" are always
 * replaced with the literal "%^" and play no role in the following
 * considerations.
 * 
 * The input string is supposed to follow this syntax:
 * 
 * text { '%^' colorkey '%^' text } [ '%^' colorkey ]
 * 
 * or in words: the efun splits up the string at every '%^' it finds
 * and then treats every second substring as color key.
 * 
 * 
 * Note that this is different from the way MudOS treats the
 * input string. MudOS uses this syntax:
 * 
 * key_or_text { '%^' key_or_text }
 * 
 * or in words: the MudOS efun splits the string at every '%^' and
 * then tries to treat every substring as color key. One can achieve
 * the MudOS behaviour with this LPC function:
 * 
 * string mudos_terminal_colour(string str, mapping ext, int w, int i) {
 * return terminal_colour("%^"+implode(explode(str, "%^")-({""})
 * ,"%^%^")
 * , ext, w, i);
 * }
 *
 * @example 
 * mapping trans;
 * string str;
 * 
 * trans = ([ "GREEN" : "ansi-green", "RED" : "", "BLUE" : 1 ]);
 * 
 * str = terminal_colour( "%^GREEN%^ and %^RED%^ and %^BLUE%^", trans );
 * 
 * This will result in str == "ansi-green and  and BLUE"
 * 
 * %^GREEN%^ is expanded to ansi-green because trans defines that,
 * %^RED%^ is stripped because trans defines that as "" and
 * %^BLUE%^ gets the %^'s removed because the contents of trans are
 * not valid (i.e. no string). The same would happen to %^DEFINES%^
 * where the key is not found inside the trans mapping.
 * 
 * Caveat: to replace adjacent keys, use the efun like this:
 * 
 * str = terminal_colour( "%^GREEN%^%^RED%^", trans );
 * 
 * A command like
 * 
 * str = terminal_colour( "%^GREEN%^RED%^", trans );
 * 
 * will return the logical but sometimes unexpected "ansi-greenRED".
 * 
 * 
 * Some words about wrapping:
 * 
 * a string wrapped without indent would look like this:
 * 
 * "this is the first line\nand this is the second line"
 * 
 * a string wrapped with indent 3 would look like:
 * 
 * "this is the first line\n   and this is the indented second one"
 *
 * @since Efun idea and initial implementation taken from MudOS; the key
        recognition strategy (including pure wrapping mode) was straightened
        out in LDMud 3.2.8.
        LDMud 3.2.9/3.3.58 added the use of closures to specify the colour
        mappings.

/**
 * sscanf
 *
 * Parse a string str using the format fmt. fmt can contain
 * strings seperated by %d and %s. Every %d and %s corresponds to
 * one of var1, var2, ... .
 * 
 * The match operators in the format string have one of these
 * formats:
 * %[+][!|~][<size>[.<minmatch>]]<type>
 * 
 * <type> may be:
 * d: matches any number.
 * D: matches any number.
 * U: matches any unsigned number.
 * s: matches any string.
 * %: matches the % character.
 * t: matches whitespace (spaces and tab characters), but does
 * not store them (the simple ' ' matches just spaces and
 * can't be given a size specification).
 * 
 * <size> is the expected field size, <minmatch> the demanded
 * minimal match length (defaults are 0 for strings and 1 for
 * numbers). Each of these both may be specified numerically, or
 * as '*' - then the value of the variable at the current place
 * in the argument list is used.
 * 
 * Specifying + will require that the characters after the field
 * match as well, or the match will be deemed unsuccessful (the variable
 * might still get assigned, though).
 * 
 * Specifying ! will perform the match, but neither store the
 * result nor count the match.
 * 
 * Specifying ~ will perform and count the match, but not store
 * the result.
 * 
 * If the %s specifier is not at the end of the format string,
 * it is matched only if the following character(s) or format
 * is found, too. See below for an example.
 * 
 * The difference between %d and %D/%U is that the latter will abort
 * an immediately preceeding %s as soon as possible, whereas the
 * former will attempt to make largest match to %s first.
 * %D/%U will still not skip whitespace, use %.0t%D to skip optional
 * whitespace.
 * 
 * If a number is matched that exceeds the numerical limits of
 * integers the match is deemed unsuccessful.
 * 
 * The number of matched arguments will be returned.
 * 
 * The function sscanf is special, in that arguments are passed
 * by reference automatically.
 *
 * @example 
 * string who, what;
 * if (sscanf("throw frisbee to rover",
 * "throw %s to %s", what, who) != 2)
 * write("Usage: throw <what> to <who>\n");
 * else
 * write("You throw a "+what+" to "+who+" to get his attention.\n");
 * 
 * sscanf("ab", "%s%s", who, what)
 * ==> result 2, who = "", what = "ab"
 * 
 * sscanf("ab", "%s %s", who, what)

 * @param fmt the format string.
 * @param args the arguments to be formatted.
 * @returns the formatted string.
 *
 * Most of the characters in the format string (FMT) get passed
 * straight through to the output (ie: printed or put in the
 * return string), to format the arguments into the string it is
 * necessary to include an argument format string (AFS) in the
 * FMT.  An AFS is a series of characters starting with a percent
 * sign "%" and terminated with a argument type specifier.
 * To include a "%" sign in the output, it is necessary to include a
 * double percent sign "%%". The sequence "%^" will output "%^" again.
 * 
 * Valid argument type specifiers are:
 * "s" : the argument is a string.
 * "d" : the argument is an integer to be included in decimal
 * representation.
 * "i" : same as "d".
 * "b" : the argument is an integer to be included in binary
 * representation.
 * "o" : the argument is an integer to be included in octal
 * representation.
 * "x" : the argument is an integer to be included in hexadecimal
 * representation.
 * "X" : as "x" except letters are capitalised.
 * "e","E","f","g","G" : the argument is a float to be included in
 * decimal representation; see examples for details
 * "c" : the argument is an int to included as a character
 * "O" : the argument is an LPC datatype to be printed in an arbituary
 * format, this is for debugging purposes.
 * If the argument is an object then the function
 * printf_obj_name() on the master object is called with the
 * object as a parameter, the string returned is included in
 * brackets at the end of object file name.
 * If 0 is returned then nothing is appended after the file name.
 * "Q"   Like "O", except that special characters in strings are
 * printed in LPC notation.
 * 
 * Between the percent sign and the argument type specifier in
 * the AFS, the following modifiers can be included to specify
 * the formatting information.  Order is not important unless
 * otherwise specified.  "n" is used to specify a integer, which
 * can be a "*" in which case the next argument is used as the
 * number.
 * 
 * Modifiers:
 * n    specifies the field size. If the size is prepended with
 * a 0, the argument is printed with leading zeroes.
 * "."n  specifies the precision, for simple (not columns or tables)
 * strings specifies the truncation length.
 * ":"n  n specifies both the field size _and_ the presision, if n is
 * prepended by a zero then the pad string is set to "0".
 * "'X'" the pad string is set to the char(s) between the single
 * quotes, if the field size is also prepended with a zero then
 * which ever is specified last will overrule.
 * NOTE:  to include "'" in the pad string, you must use "\\'"
 * (as the backslash has to be escaped past the interpreter),
 * similarly, to include "\" requires "\\\\".
 * " "   pad positive integers with a space.
 * "+"   pad positive integers with a plus sign.
 * "-"   left aligned within field size.
 * NB: std (s)printf() defaults to right alignment, which is
 * unnatural in the context of a mainly string based language
 * but has been retained for "compatibility" ;)
 * "|"   centered within field size.
 * "$"   justified to field size. Ignored unless the type specifier
 * is 's'.
 * "="   column mode.  Ignored unless the argument type specifier is 's'.
 * Field size must be specified, if precision is specified then
 * it specifies the width for the string to be wordwrapped in, if
 * not then the field size is. The field size specifies the width
 * of the column and has the effect that the last line of the
 * column is padded with spaces to achieve this length.
 * "#"   For strings: table mode.
 * Field size must be specified, if precision is
 * specified then it specifies the number of columns in
 * the table, otherwise the number is "optimally"
 * generated (as few lines and columns as possible).
 * Table mode is passed a list of backslash-n separated
 * 'words' which are put in a format similar to that of
 * ls.
 * For %O/%Q: compact output.
 * "@"   the argument is an array.  the corresponding AFS (minus all
 * "@") is applied to each element of the array.
 * 
 * When the formatting of an element results in several output lines
 * (column or table mode) and no explicit pad strings has been
 * defined, then the efun removes any padding whitespace before
 * the newlines of all but the last line. However, if an explicit
 * pad string has been given, even if it is the simple ' ', then
 * the padding will not be removed.
 *
 * @since LDMud 3.2.9 added the "%^" sequence for compatibility with
          terminal_colour(), added the "%Q" sequence, clarified the meaning of
          leading 0s in the field size modifier, clarified the interaction
          between the padding and newlines, and added the '$' formatter for
          justified printing of strings.
        LDMud 3.2.10 added modifier '#' for '%O'/'%Q' and the datatype '%b'.
 *
 * @example 
 * sprintf("decimal=%d, octal=%o, hexadecimal=%x\n", 7, 7, 7);
 * 
 * sprintf("array=%O\n", ({1, 2, 3}));
 * 
 * this will return the following:
 * ({ /* sizeof() == 3 *\/
 * 1,
 * 2,
 * 3
 * })
 * An array will be printed recursively and each element of the
 * array will be indented. Can also be used as a debugging tool.

 * CAVEAT: If the lfun catch_msg() modifies the content of <msg>, all

 * 
 * By specifying a second argument to the efun one can exclude

 * is a single object <exclude>, both the given object and the

 * is an array <excludes>, all objects and just the objects in

 * - if the say() is called from within a living object, this
 * becomes the initiator
 * - if the say() is called from within a dead object as result

 * replace_program() to increase the function-cache hit-rate of the

 * replace the program and then bind lambda closures to it.

 * The program replacement does not take place with the call to the efun,

/**
 * present
 *
 * This efun checks if an object is present in a given environment.
 * The object is identified by id <str> or by an object <ob>. This
 * latter form of the efun can be used as a fast way to test for the
 * presence of a known object.
 * 
 * When searching objects by id, the efun by default returns the first
 * object found matching the id. In order to search for other than the
 * first object, a number can be specified either directly as the
 * argument <n>, or implicetely inside the <str> in the form "<id>
 * <n>".
 * 
 * By default, the efun searches first in the inventory of
 * this_object(), then in its environment. However, if <env> is given,
 * the efun searches just inside <env>.
 * 
 * When searching both inventory and environment of this_object(),
 * the numbering is applied linear over both spaces (see examples).
 * 
 * The driver identifies objects by calling the lfun id() in each
 * object.
 *
 * @example 
 * present("chest");
 * --> returns the first 'chest' object in this object.
 * 
 * present("chest 2")
 * --> returns the second 'chest' object in this object.
 * 
 * present("chest 2", 1)
 * --> returns the first 'chest 2' object in this object.
 * 
 * Assume there is one "chest" inside the current object, and
 * two in its environment:
 * present("chest", 1) -> returns the chest inside
 * present("chest", 2) -> returns the first chest outside
 * present("chest", 3) -> returns the second chest outside
 * 
 * A typical 2.4.5-implementation of the "do <id> <n>" command style
 * is:
 * 
 * void init() { add_action("open_chest", "open"); }
 * 
 * int open_chest (string str) {
 * if (present (str) != this_object ())
 * return 0; /* Not this chest *\/
 * ...
 * }
 *
 * @since LDMud 3.2.11/3.3.610 introduced the (str, n) argument form.
        LDMud 3.3.713 modified the <n> search behaviour so that the
          numbering is applied over both inventory and environment
          together. Before, the numbering was individual in each
          space, leading to situations where low-numbered objects in the
          environment were hidden by those in the inventory.

/**
 * parse_command
 *
 * parse_command() is basically a spiffed up sscanf operating
 * on word basis and targeted at recognizing object descriptions from
 * command strings.
 * 
 * The efun takes the command string <cmd> and the object(s) <env>/<arr>
 * and tries to match it against the format string <fmt>. Successfully
 * matched elements are assigned to the variables <var>.... The result
 * from the efun is 1 if the command could be fully matched, and 0
 * otherwise.
 * 
 * If the objects are given as a single object <env>, the efun matches
 * against the given object and all objects contained therein. Otherwise,
 * if the objects are given as an array <arr> of objects, the efun
 * matches only against the given objects.
 * 
 * The format string <fmt> consists of words, syntactic markers, and
 * %-directives for the values to parse and return in the variables.
 * A typical example is " 'get' / 'take' %i " or
 * " 'spray' / 'paint' [paint] %i ". The elements in detail are:
 * 
 * 'word': obligatory text
 * [word]: optional text
 * /     : Alternative marker
 * %o    : Single item, object
 * %s    : Any text
 * %w    : Any word
 * %p    : One of a list of prepositions.
 * If the variable associated with %p is used to pass
 * a list of words to the efun, the matching will take
 * only against this list.
 * %l    : non-compat: Living objects
 * compat: a single living object
 * %i    : Any objects
 * %d    : Number >= 0, or when given textual: 0-99.
 * 
 * A <word> in this context is any sequence of characters not containing
 * a space. 'living objects' are searched by calls to the (simul)efuns
 * find_player() and find_living(): both functions have to accept a name
 * as argument and return the object for this name, or 0 if there
 * is none.
 * 
 * The results assigned to the variables by the %-directives are:
 * 
 * %o : returns an object
 * %s : returns a string of words
 * %w : returns a string of one word
 * %p : if passed empty: a string
 * if passed as array of words: var[0] is the matched word
 * %i : returns an array with the following content:
 * [0]: int: the count/number recognized in the object spec
 * > 0: a count (e.g. 'three', '4')
 * < 0: an ordinal (e.g. 'second', 'third')
 * = 0: 'all' or a generic plural such as 'apples'
 * [1..]: object: all(!) objects matching the item description.
 * In the <env> form this may be the whole
 * recursive inventory of the <env> object.
 * It is up to the caller to interpret the recognized numeral
 * and to apply it on the list of matched objects.
 * %l : non-compat: as %i, except that only living objects are
 * returned.
 * compat: as %o, except that only a living object is returned.
 * 
 * %i (and non-compat-%l) match descriptions like 'three red roses',
 * 'all nasty bugs' or 'second blue sword'.
 * 
 * Note: Patterns of type: "%s %w %i" might not work as one would expect.
 * %w will always succeed so the arg corresponding to %s will always be
 * empty.
 * 
 * To make the efun useful it must have a certain support from the
 * mudlib: it calls a set of functions in objects to get the
 * information it needs to parse a string.
 * 
 * 1. string *parse_command_id_list()
 * Normal singular names of the object.
 * 
 * 2. string *parse_command_plural_id_list() - optional
 * Plural forms of the names returned by 1.
 * If this function doesn't exist, the parser tries to pluralize
 * the names returned by 1.
 * 
 * 3. string *parse_command_adjectiv_id_list() -  optional
 * All adjectives associated with this object.
 * 
 * All names and adjectives may consist of several words separated
 * by spaces.
 * 
 * These functions should exist in all objects and are therefore best
 * put into a mandatory inherit file (e.g. /std/object.c).
 * 
 * In addition the master object may offer the same functions to provide
 * reasonable defaults (like 'thing' as generic singular name):
 * 
 * string *parse_command_id_list()
 * - Would normally return: ({ "one", "thing" })
 * 
 * string *parse_command_plural_id_list()
 * - Would normally return: ({ "ones", "things", "them" })
 * 
 * string *parse_command_adjectiv_id_list()
 * - Would normally return ({ "iffish" })
 * 
 * Two additional functions in the master object provide the default
 * list of prepositions (needed for %p) and the single 'all' word:
 * 
 * string *parse_command_prepos_list()
 * - Would normally return: ({ "in", "on", "under", "behind",
 * "beside" })
 * 
 * string parse_command_all_word()
 * - Would normally return: "all"
 * 
 * 
 * int parse_command(string, object|object*, string, destargs...)
 *
 * @example 
 * object *items;
 * parse_command("take apple",environment(this_player()),
 * " 'get' / 'take' %i ", items);

 * stored under their corresponding key.

 * per key, and mappings of arrays) can be treated in the same way.

 * INPUT_IGNORE_BANG flag.
 * The function <fun> may be static, but must not be private (or
 * it won't be found).
 * 
 * Note that fun is not called immediately but after pressing the
 * RETURN key.
 * 
 * Usually, if input_to() is called more than once in the same execution,
 * only the first call has any effect. This behaviour can be
 * modified by specifying the INPUT_APPEND flag which will append
 * the given input_to to the already existing input_tos (see
 * EXAMPLES).
 * 
 * Also, if a command given during an input_to() (using the "!"
 * escape) issues its own input_to(), the previous input_to() is
 * suspended until the new input_to() has been handled, then the
 * previous one becomes active again.
 * 
 * The optional argument <flag> may be a binary-OR ('|') of the
 * following option values:
 * 
 * INPUT_NOECHO  (1):
 * The line given by the player will not be echoed, and is
 * not seen if snooped.
 * 
 * A change of this mode not possible with telnet disabled.
 * 
 * INPUT_CHARMODE  (2):
 * The connection is switched from line- into charmode to
 * retrieve a single character(!) from the player.
 * 
 * Is telnet disabled, then only the handling of the
 * incoming data by the driver is changed - the client
 * program of the player will remain in its current mode.
 * 
 * After execution of <fun>, the connection is switched
 * back into linemode unless a subsequent input_to( , 2)
 * has been issued.
 * 
 * Lineends are received exactly as the client sent them:
 * "\n", "\r" followed by "\n", or just "\r".
 * 
 * Note that the players frontend is free to stay in
 * linemode all the time: even if you request a single
 * character, the player might be forced to type (and send)
 * that character plus the return key. Usually your function
 * will then receive the complete input line (including the
 * newline character sequence!) in one call.
 * 
 * If you plan to stay in charmode a longer time , you can
 * reduce the call overhead by using set_combine_charset()
 * to retrieve sequences of certain characters as one string
 * instead of one-by-one. In a screen-oriented editor for
 * example this would be most of the printable characters.
 * 
 * INPUT_PROMPT (4):
 * The argument following the <flag> argument is used as
 * prompt for the input. If this flag is not given, and thus
 * no prompt specified, nothing will be printed.
 * 
 * INPUT_NO_TELNET (8):
 * Modifies the INPUT_CHARMODE flag: the driver will switch
 * it's internal handling of incoming data, but not send out
 * any telnet commands to switch the client's behaviour.
 * 
 * INPUT_APPEND (16):
 * Append the input_to to the list of currently pending input_tos
 * (if any).
 * 
 * INPUT_IGNORE_BANG  (128):
 * Input lines starting with '!' (or whatever the input
 * escape character was configured to be) will _not_ be parsed as
 * commands, but are given to the function as well. Usage
 * of this option is privileged.
 * 
 * The optional trailing args will be passed as second and
 * subsequent args to the function fun.
 *
 * @example 
 * void func() {
 * ...
 * input_to("enter_name", INPUT_PROMPT, "Please enter your name:");
 * /* The traditional way of doing this was:
 * *   write("Please enter your name:");
 * *   input_to("enter_name");
 * *\/
 * ...
 * }
 * enter_name(string str) {
 * write("Is '"+str+"' really your name?? *giggle*\n");
 * ...
 * }
 * 
 * When reaching the input_to() statement the driver
 * continues the function func() but also asks the user for
 * input. If you entered whatever is asked and press RETURN the
 * driver will invoke the enter_name() function with the
 * string you entered as argument to it.
 * 
 * 
 * void func() {
 * ..
 * input_to("enter_firstname");
 * input_to("enter_lastname, INPUT_APPEND);
 * ...
 * }
 * 
 * This sequence will queue two input_tos: the input first goes
 * to enter_firstname(); and when this function is done
 * (including any non-INPUT_APPEND input_to()s on its own), the next
 * input will go to enter_lastname().
 * 
 * 
 * Note that the list of input_to-s is treated as a flat list:
 * 
 * void func() {
 * ..
 * input_to("func1");
 * input_to("func2", INPUT_APPEND);
 * }
 * 
 * void func1() {
 * ..
 * input_to("func3", INPUT_APPEND);
 * }
 * 
 * void func2() { ... }
 * void func3() { ... }
 * 
 * This code will result in the functions being called in the order
 * func(), func1(), func2(), func3(); and not func(), func1(), func3(),
 * func2().
 *
 * @since The meaning of the flag parameter was extended in 3.2.1@93.
        The limited "stacking" of input_to()s issued from !-commands
        was implemented in LDMud 3.2.8.

        LDMud 3.2.11/3.3.637 added the INPUT_APPEND flag.
        LDMud 3.3 changed the handling of newline sequences in charmode
          to verbatim passing. Earlier drivers passed an empty string
          instead.
        LDMud 3.3 allowed the driver to be configured to use a different

 * 
 * string [i+0]: the name as it appeared in the program, including the
 * delimiters ("" or <>, resp.).
 * string [i+1]: the absolute filename of the include file.
 * int    [i+2]: the inclusion depth (usually 1, more for nested
 * includes).
 * 
 * The first entry in the result is the program's own name in [i+0],
 * the other two elements [i+1] and [i+2] are 0.
 * 
 * The <flag> determines the exact structure of the result:
 * 
 * <flag> = INCLIST_FLAT (0, default):
 * The result is a flat array of the entries, starting the with
 * the entry for <ob> itself, followed by the entries for all
 * included files in the order they were encountered.
 * 
 * <flag> = INCLIST_TREE (1):
 * The result is an array starting the with the entry
 * of <ob> itself, followed by the entries for all directly included
 * files. If one of the included files has no nested includes by itself,
 * then its information will be stored directly in the array.
 * If one included file has includes by itself, a subvector will
 * be created and stored in the result vector (again in [i+0], with
 * [i+1] and [i+2] being 0). These subvectors have the same
 * structure as the main result vector.
 * 
 * If objects, including <ob>, had been undergone a replace_program(),
 * the returned filenames will reflect the actual active program.
 * 
 * The returned proper include filenames always begin with '/' (absolute
 * path), even when the parser runs in COMPAT mode. The filename of
 * the object itself however does not begin with a '/' in COMPAT
 * mode.
 *
 * @example 
 * Given this source code (and /sys as system include directory):
 * 
 * a.c:  #include "b.h"
 * #include <c.h>
 * b.h:  #include "d.h"
 * c.h:  #define BAR
 * d.h:  #define FOO
 * 
 * the efun will give these results:
 * 
 * include_list(a, INCLIST_FLAT)
 * -> ({ "a.c", 0, 0
 * , "\"b.h\"", "/.../b.h", 1

/**
 * destruct
 *

 * longer, only local ones, and arguments.

 * If an object self-destructs, it will not immediately terminate
 * execution. If the efun this_object() will be called by the
 * destructed object, the result will be 0. Furthermore, all
 * calls to other objects and to simul-efuns will be ignored, instead
 * the driver will return 0 als 'call' result.
 * 
 * To keep things consistent, most mudlibs frown upon the
 * destruct()ion of other objects, and instead demand call_others
 * to a specific lfun in the object to destruct (traditionally
 * named "remove"). This will then ensure correct update of e.g.
 * weights, volumes etc. Additionally or instead, the master apply
 * prepare_destruct() can be used for this 'cleanup' functionality.
 * 
 * The interpreter does not really destruct the object
 * immediately, but marks it as deleted, removes it from the list
 * of all objects, and puts it onto a list of to-be-destructed
 * objects. The actual freeing occurs only when all references to
 * a destructed object have gone. Thus it is possible, that an
 * object occupies memory long after it has been destructed,
 * although the object is not visible anywhere anymore from
 * outside.
 *
 * @example 
 * ob->remove();
 * if(ob)        /* still there, probably ob does not provide remove() *\/
 * destruct(ob);
 * 
 * This is a way of destructing an object but giving it a chance

 * <what> == IC_SOCKET_BUFFER_SIZE
 * Changes the socket buffer size to the given size in bytes.
 * Not every operating system might provide this option to
 * change the buffer size.
 * 
 * The buffer size is used for sending, when the remote side isn't
 * getting the data fast enough. When the socket buffer is full,

 * 
 * The newline '\n', the NUL character '\0' and non-ASCII

 * 
 * The given string should contain all combinable characters.
 * If given as the number 0, the default combine charset is
 * re-established.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_COMBINE_CHARSET_AS_ARRAY
 * Set the set of characters which can be combined into a single
 * string, just like IC_COMBINE_CHARSET_AS_STRING.
 * 
 * The given array shall contain an array of up to 16 integers
 * that are interpreted as 8-bit-values. Each character is encoded
 * as one bit (ASCII characters 0-7 in the first integer, and so on).
 * So a character <n> is treated as combinable if

 * characters). This does not apply to unicode characters > 127
 * or to binary_message().

 * The given string should contain all allowed characters.
 * If given as the number 0, the default charset is re-established.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_CONNECTION_CHARSET_AS_ARRAY

 * The given array shall contain an array of up to 16 integers
 * that are interpreted as 8-bit-values. Each character is encoded

 * array[n/8] & (1 << n%8)
 * 
 * If the array contains less elements, the missing elements will
 * be regarded as 0 (not allowed, ie. to be discarded).
 * 
 * <what> == IC_QUOTE_IAC
 * Sets whether the character 255 (telnet IAC) shall be quoted
 * by prepending another IAC character, so it will not be interpreted
 * by the telnet protocol. Enable with 1, disable with 0. By default
 * it is enabled and does only apply if character 255 is allowed to
 * be output (ie. it is part of the connection charset).
 * 
 * <what> == IC_TELNET_ENABLED
 * Enables (1) or disables (0) the telnet machine for the interactive
 * user <ob>. When deactivated the driver won't handle telnet
 * negotiations (eg. H_TELNET_NEG won't be called), they will be
 * part of the user input. Also INPUT_NOECHO won't be effective
 * as the driver won't send any telnet negotiations itself.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_MCCP
 * Starts oder ends MCCP compression of the driver -> client traffic.
 * <data> must be the MCCP version (either TELOPT_COMPRESS or
 * TELOPT_COMPRESS2 from <telnet.h>). When the telnet machine
 * is disabled, any value other then zero will do, and the compression
 * starts without a telnet preamble.
 * 
 * Available only if the driver is compiled with MCCP enabled;
 * __MCCP__ is defined in that case.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_PROMPT
 * Sets the prompt for the interactive user <ob> to <data>. The
 * prompt can either be a string or a closure that will be called
 * each time the prompt is shown.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_MAX_COMMANDS
 * Sets the max number of commands the interactive user <ob> is
 * allowed to execute per second to <data>. A negative value means
 * 'unlimited' and is the setting for newly created connections.
 * 
 * A 'command' in this context means every received data packet
 * which causes a LPC call - actions and calls to input_to()
 * alike.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_MODIFY_COMMAND
 * Sets an object that will act as a modifier for each command.
 * All commands for the interactive user <ob> will be passed to
 * data->modify_command() before actually being executed.
 * <data> must be given as an object.
 * 
 * When an object is set, the H_MODIFY_COMMAND hook wont be
 * called anymore. 0 as argument will stop the command modification
 * and reinstall the use of that driver hook.
 * 
 * This mechanism is intended to expand aliases on quicktypers
 * or the like. The name of the lfun called can be changed
 * from modify_command() to something else using the
 * H_MODIFY_COMMAND_FNAME hook.
 * 
 * <what> == IC_ENCODING
 * Sets the encoding to convert the network input to/from.
 * All received bytes (except telnet negotiations) will be converted
 * using this encoding to the internal unicode representation.
 * And all text strings will be converted back to this encoding
 * when sent to the interactive.
 * 
 * Default is "ISO-8859-1//TRANSLIT".

 * When loading certificates their fingerprints are printed
 * on stdout and into the logfile.
 * 
 * <what> == DC_TLS_DHE_PARAMETER
 * Sets new parameters for the Diffie-Hellman keyexchange for new TLS
 * sessions. The paramters must be given as a PEM encoded string

 * error values (other than 0) as given to throw() and raise_error() are
 * returned as they are.
 * 
 * If at the time the catch() is encountered less than
 * __CATCH_EVAL_COST__ eval ticks are left, a runtime error will be
 * thrown from inside the catch() (and thus caught like every other
 * error) and the expressions will not be executed. The 'reserve'
 * modifier can be used to reserve a different amount of eval ticks.
 * 
 * The default behaviour of catch() can be changed using modifiers:
 * 
 * 'nolog':   Normally, the caught error will be logged in the
 * error logs for easier debugging. With this
 * modifier, the log is suppressed.
 * 
 * 'publish': Normally, master::runtime_error() is not called
 * for a caught error. This modifier instructs
 * catch() to call it nevertheless.
 * 
 * 'reserve <expr>': The expression has to evaluate to a number
 * greater than 0 and is used to determine the amount
 * of eval ticks to reserve, instead of the default
 * of __CATCH_EVAL_COST__. The minimum required
 * are 2 * __MASTER_EVAL_COST__.
 * 'limit <expr>': The expression has to evaluate to a number
 * greater than 0 and is used to limit the eval cost
 * for the evaluation of the expression.
 * 
 * catch() itself is not expensive as far as execution time is
 * concerned: it is about the same as a intra-object function call.
 * 
 * throw() is not very expensive either, but does include the
 * internal cleanup of several structures.
 * 
 * Real runtime errors on the other hand are expensive regardless
 * of whether they are caught or not, as they include the generation
 * of the stack backtrace.

/**
 * call_direct
 *
 * Call a member function <fun> in another object <ob> with
 * argument(s) <arg...>. Result is the value returned from
 * the called function (or 0 for non-existing or void functions).
 * 
 * This efun is a twin to call_other(), with the difference
 * being that call_direct() never calls a default method.
 * 
 * Additionally the efun accepts an array of objects as <ob>: the
 * function is called with the same arguments in all the given objects.
 * The single results are collected in an array and yield the final
 * result.  Array elements can be objects or the names of existing
 * objects; destructed objects and 0s will yield a '0' as result, but
 * don't cause an error.
 * 
 * The object(s) can be given directly or via a string (i.e. its
 * object_name). If it is given by a string and the object does not
 * exist yet, it will be loaded.
 * 
 * ob->fun(args) and "ob_name"->fun(args) is equivalent to
 * call_other(ob, "fun", args). Nowadays the ob_name string can
 * also be a variable.
 * 
 * ob->fun(args) and ob->"fun"(args) are equivalent to
 * call_other(ob, "fun", args). ob->(fun)(args) are equivalent
 * to call_other(ob, fun, args) where fun is a runtime expression
 * returning the function name.
 * 
 * If ob::fun does not define a publicly accessible function, the
 * call_other() will return 0, which is indistinguishable from
 * a function returning 0.
 * 
 * "publicly accessible" means "public" when calling other objects,
 * and "public" or "static" when calling this_object(). "private"
 * and "protected" function can never be called with call_other().
 * 
 * The return type of call_other() is 'any' be default. However,
 * if your LPC code uses #pragma strict_types, the return type is
 * 'unknown', and the result of call_other() must be casted to
 * the appropriate type before you can use it for anything.
 *
 * @example 
 * ```
 * // All the following statements call the lfun QueryProp()
 * // in the current player with the argument P_SHORT.
 * string str, fun;
 * 
 * str = (string)call_direct(this_player(), "QueryProp", P_SHORT);
 * fun = "QueryProp";
 * str = (string)call_direct(this_player(), fun, P_SHORT);
 * ```
 * You have to do explicit type casting because of the unknown
 * return type, if you have set #pragma strict_types.
 * ```
 * // This statement calls the lfun short() in all interactive users
 * // and stores the collected results in a variable.
 * string *s;
 * 
 * s = (string *)call_direct(users(), "short");
 * ```

 * add_action

 * Set up a local function fun to be called when user input
 * matches the command cmd. Functions called by a user command
 * will get the arguments as a string. It must then return 0 if
 * it was the wrong command, otherwise 1.
 * 
 * If it was the wrong command, the parser will continue
 * searching for another command, until one returns 1 or give an
 * error message to the user.
 * 
 * For example, there can be a wand and a rod. Both of these
 * objects define as command "wave". One of them will be randomly
 * called first, and it must look at the argument, and match
 * against "wand" or "rod" respectively.
 * 
 * The function associated to a command will be called with a
 * string as argument which stands for the given words behind the
 * typed command. The verb entered can be retrieved using the
 * query_verb() efun and is always the first word in the input
 * line up to the first space.
 * 
 * Always have add_action() called only from an init() routine.
 * The object defining these commands must be present to the
 * user, either being the user, being carried by the user,
 * being the room around the user, or being an object in the
 * same room as the user. If the player leaves this vicinity of the
 * object, the actions are automatically removed.
 * 
 * Actions can also be removed on demand with the remove_actions() efun.
 * 
 * If argument <flag> is AA_SHORT (1), then the arguments may
 * follow the verb without separating space. Any arguments after
 * the first space are passed as argument string.
 * 
 * If argument <flag> is AA_NOSPACE (2), then again the arguments
 * may follow the verb without separating space. In contrast to
 * AA_SHORT, all characters following the verb are passed as
 * the argument string. However, note that the characters immediately
 * following the given verb are passed as argument AND as result
 * of query_verb().
 * 
 * If argument <flag> is AA_IMM_ARGS (3), then again the arguments
 * may follow the verb without separating space. All characters following
 * the given verb are passed as argument, and only as argument.
 * 
 * If argument <flag> is negative, the verb given by the player
 * has to match only the leading -<flag> characters of the verb <cmd>.
 * 
 * Never use one of the functions 'create' 'reset' 'init' 'exit'
 * 'heart_beat' etc as the first argument to add_action(). In
 * general, a function with a name defined in /doc/applied should
 * have the behaviour defined there.
 *
 * @example 
 * ```
 * add_action("GoInside", "enter");
 * ```
 * 
 * When typing "enter" the function GoInside() will be invoked.
 * ```
 * add_action("DisFunc", "dis", AA_SHORT);
 * ```
 * Whenever you type in a command which starts with "dis" the
 * function DisFunc() will be called. To get the real word which
 * was typed in (because until now you only know that it was a
 * command beginning with "dis") you have to call the efun
 * query_verb().
 * ```
 * add_action("DisFunc", "disconnect", AA_NOSPACE);
 * ```
 * The function DisFunc() will be called for all commands which
 * use "disconnect" or a shortened form like "di", "dis" or
 * "discon" as verb. The command 'disconnecting' will _not_
 * be recognized. To get the real word which was typed in
 * you have to call the efun query_verb().
 * 
 * ```
 * add_action("...", "cmd");
 * add_action("...", "xcmd", AA_SHORT);
 * add_action("...", "scmd", AA_NOSPACE);
 * add_action("...", "icmd", AA_IMM_ARGS);
 * ```
 * When given the following commands, the driver will parse it
 * as described below. 'verb' is what query_verb() would return,
 * 'arg' is what would be passed to the command function.
 * ```
 * "cmd"          -> verb "cmd",     arg 0
 * "cmd foo bar"  -> verb "cmd",     arg "foo bar"
 * 
 * "xcmd"         -> verb "xcmd",    arg 0
 * "xcmd foo"     -> verb "xcmd",    arg "foo"
 * "xcmdfoo"      -> verb "xcmdfoo", arg 0
 * "xcmd foo bar" -> verb "xcmd",    arg "foo bar"
 * "xcmdfoo bar"  -> verb "xcmdfoo", arg "bar"
 * 
 * "scmd"         -> verb "scmd",    arg 0
 * "scmd foo"     -> verb "scmd",    arg " foo"
 * "scmdfoo"      -> verb "scmdfoo", arg "foo"
 * "scmd foo bar" -> verb "scmd",    arg " foo bar"
 * "scmdfoo bar"  -> verb "scmdfoo", arg "foo bar"
