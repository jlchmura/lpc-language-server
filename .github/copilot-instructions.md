This project is a vscode language server and compiler for the LPC language. It is based on the TypeScript compiler.

Github issues are used to track work items.

We use npm for package management, and esbuild to build and bundle. Jest is used for tests.

There are several .c and .h files in this project. Those contain `LPC` code, not `C`.
